Installation of the library is accomplished by running the commands:

make 
sudo make install

You can set CFLAGS at the commandline. Default is '-g -O0 -Wall'. For optimized code without
debugging symbols try:

make CFLAGS='-O2 -Wall'
sudo make install
 
Uninstallation is accomplished:

sudo make uninstall

The install and uninstall target supports the prefix variable and the default is equal to:

sudo make prefix=/usr install


Documentation is both man and html. To build the html docs run

make docs

To build the html and install html and man docs:

sudo make install-docs

To uninstall docs:

sudo make uninstall-docs

There are two clean targets:

make clean
make clean-docs


There are two test targets:

make check
make memtest

The first runs unit tests and the second runs valgrind on the unit tests.

There are two targets to support distribution:

make distcheck
make dist

The variable DESTDIR is supported for these targets.
